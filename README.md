# deploy_django_app
A template of a django app (authentification only) with configuration for CI workflow

## Feedbacks from Travis implementation :
- Python 3.7 not supported (on 29/01/19)
- It is not possible to run directly ./manage.py without changing the rights. It is better to use directly "python manage.py"
